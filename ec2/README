manage your ec2 cluster with spark in an easy manner.
control cluster from local machine in a single call.
(need python3 installed)

*ec2_spark_launcher*:
    --  launch / login / destroy ec2 clusters
    --  cd to parent directory, then
        `python3 -m ec2.ec2_spark_launcher --help`
        to see how you can configure your launch

*ec2_spark_submit*:
    --  submit application to already launched ec2 cluster
        call this script after you call `ec2_spark_launcher` with `--launch`
    --  cd to parent directory, then
        `python3 -m ec2.ec2_spark_submit --help`
        to see what you can do

*TODO*:
    --  `ec2_spark_submit`: support submisssion of user script to be run on cluster
